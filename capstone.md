Pulling data - data is either national, by state, by city, by Metropolitian Statistical Area (MSA), by county.
I made the decision to look at MSA. Since when you retire you tend to retire to a region not to a specific region. For example if I want to retire to Asheville, I will look in Asheville and the surrounding area.

My concern is the consistency of the data. I am pulling data from different sources - government, non-profits and commerical sites. Some data is actual numbers, rankings, index, percentages.
